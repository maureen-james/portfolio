My goal is to be a web developer and change my career path. To achieve this, I have to learn different programming languages  and frameworks. At Moringa School, I will also learn more about Django and Angular. I will also learn project management and implementing my own projects and also holding myself accountable . I'll also partner with other software developers teams learn from them and improve my soft skills.
